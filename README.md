# Ameen's Custom Products Catalog App

This project is a Wix-based React application that provides store owners with a custom dashboard to manage their Wix Stores catalog. It includes functionality for viewing, creating, and deleting products, and offers a dedicated interface for discounting the most expensive product that hasnâ€™t yet been discounted.

The app was scaffolded using [`@wix/create-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wix/create-app).  
For more details on how Wix apps work, see the [Wix CLI for Apps documentation](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/developer-tools/cli/get-started/about-the-wix-cli-for-apps).

## Features

- List and manage products directly from the dashboard
- Add new products through a custom modal interface
- Delete individual or multiple products using built-in toolbar actions
- Display the most expensive product using a dashboard plugin
- Apply a percentage-based discount through a dedicated page
