Ameen's Custom Products Catalog App
This project is a Wix-based React application that provides store owners with a custom dashboard to manage their Wix Stores catalog. It includes functionality for viewing, creating, and deleting products, and offers a dedicated interface for discounting the most expensive product that hasnâ€™t yet been discounted.

The app was scaffolded using @wix/create-app.
For more details on how Wix apps work, see the Wix CLI for Apps documentation.
